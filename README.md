## Description

 Reduction pipeline for Tull coude spectrograph

 This pipeline is based on a python 2 reduction pipeline written by Daniel Krolikowski (based on initial work from Aaron Rizzuto) at UT Austin
 The original pipeline can be found at this repository: X

 This new reduction pipeline is designed to be more user friendly and will work in python 3.
 I decided to start fresh rather than make modifications in the above python 2 repository because there will be many changes to the layout and format of the code.
