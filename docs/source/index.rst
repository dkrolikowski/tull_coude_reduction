Documentation for the Tull coudé reduction and analysis pipeline
================================================================

Welcome to the documentation for the reduction and analysis pipeline for the Tull coudé echelle spectrograph 
on the 2.7-m Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory.

This pipeline was written by `Daniel Krolikowski <https://dkrolikowski.github.io>`_, a former UT Austin grad student and frequent user of this instrument.

This documentation includes descriptions of the reduction steps, how those steps are implemented, and how to use the pipeline.
There is also discussion of where the pipeline is more general/modular and where it is written more specifically for this instrument.

.. note::

   This documentation is being actively written, and the project is still in a testing and development state.
