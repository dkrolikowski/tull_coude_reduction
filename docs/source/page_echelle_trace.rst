Tracing Echelle Orders
======================

Steps:

- use the flat field, as it is bright and fills the slit making edge and center of trace clear
- Get initial location at the edge (just before overscan region)
- Then follow that along each order image, re-centering
- Fit the trace with a polynomial
- Do some vetting by fitting trace parameters across order -- replace bad orders
